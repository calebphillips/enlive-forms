# enlive-forms

An experiment with using enlive to generate forms.  

I wanted to focus specifically on functional validation and html generation.

The skeleton of this code was cobbled together with bits from:

* http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/clojure-web-application
* https://github.com/swannodette/enlive-tutorial/
* https://github.com/cgrand/enlive/wiki/Table-and-Layout-Tutorial,-Part-1:-The-Goal

Reading the enlive documentation and source was also very important.

## Usage

If you have foreman installed, you can start the app with 'foreman start' and then visit http://localhost:5000
